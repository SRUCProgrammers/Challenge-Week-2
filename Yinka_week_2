Created a new column called "Year"  and used the function "=YEAR()" in excel
Read the data in as a .txt file in R
data<-read.table("week2.txt",header=T,sep='\t')

#exclude missing values
newdata <- na.omit(week2)

#remove columns without information, data with complete information
week2[!complete.cases(week2),]
> newdata <- na.omit(week2)
View(newdata)
> summary(newdata)

#subset the newdata to show each trait per year
Year15<-subset(newdata,newdata$Year=="2015")
>View(Year15)

There will be an easier way of doing this. Teach me:)
