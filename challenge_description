Challenge description (submitted by Alex Brown)

You have 200(ish) cows of varying ages, with data on sex, date of birth, and 2 
traits. You want to find out whether there has been phenotypic progress in your trait(s) 
of interest over time. Your data has dates of birth in it, but you only need Year of
Birth. Extract this information from your data. Can you plot your trait in a way that 
separates the cows by year of birth? How do you quantify the level of progress (if any) 
in your trait over time?

Why? This is again probably a lot simpler than some of the others, but again like Suzanne 
I think a lot of beginners will want more practice with data manipulation. This is a pretty 
boring work related task but is the sort of thing that you might want to look at at the 
beginning of a genetic analysis? Its also something that could maybe be extended at a later date.
