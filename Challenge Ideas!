This is the file where we'll collect ideas for next weeks challenge! Please enter your name, a brief description of what you're 
proposing and why you think it's a good idea! 
Once we have enough (I hope you all can think of one! Please append the file with a an exclamation (!) mark beside your favourite idea, we'll count these
to decide the winner. 
The person with the best idea will host the meet!

Task: Estimate the number of rabbits in a population after 10 years
--a newly born pair of rabbits, one male, one female, build the initial population
--at the end of its second month a female can bring forth another pair of rabbits - and each month thereafter
--these rabbits are immortal (easy) OR rabbits die at 1 year of age (harder)
-- mating pair always produces one new pair (one male, one female) every month from the second month onwards
Why? this is a simple concept: can we translate it into code?

Task: Rise of the MACHINES -- Study a population of terminators over time.
**Scenario 1** (a bit easier)
-- Terminators are created by SKYNET at rate a
-- Terminators are killed by humans at rate b
AND/OR
**Scenario 2** (a bit harder)
-- Terminators are created by SKYNET at rate a
-- Terminators are killed by humans at rate b
-- Resources for the creation of Terminators is finite, i.e., Terminators have a carrying capacity K
Why? Scenarios 1 and 2 are examples of simple exponential and logistic growth respectively, and form a basis for modelling
in the fields of mathematical biology and epidemiology. I have chosen Terminators as a bit of fun but these ideas can be (and
are) applied to many population and disease systems. If people are interested in coding this problem I can give a brief
introduction to the models and their solution and we can look to write up some code in our chosen languages to solve such
problems. The type of modelling used above can be applied to many fields from traffic flow to wound healing, and is used to
study a multitude of problems in areas such as cancer growth and magnetohydrodynamics. Finally, the ideas involved in
*scenario 2* also have applications in statistics and could potentially be useful in your own area of study (you may have
already encountered it, e.g., logistic regression!).

Meeting notes: 

Hi everyone. I really enjoyed the meeting this week and I think it’s 
going to be useful. I think we need to focus the next meeting a bit 
more so that everyone gets the most out of it.
 
Rather than go through everybody’s code, I think a better use of time 
would be for people to highlight any particular problems they had with 
the challenge. Then we can find out who managed to solve that specific 
problem, go through how they did it, and take suggestions on how it 
could be improved. We can also share neat solutions to problems we 
encountered. 

I think this will focus the discussion and allow people (especially 
those new to programming) to ask specific questions. It’s a bit overwhelming 
to look at a wall of code you don’t understand!  

Next challenge:

My suggestion is waaay more boring than rise of the machines! :D I’m 
personally keen to practice more data manipulation. I’m not suggesting 
we do this exact thing, but if people are keen I can come up with 
something along these lines. I recently did an analysis using SAS where 
I standardised values around the mean, then took a subset of individuals 
based on values in the top 10% for one trait, and graphed how values for 
other traits compared in that subset. I understand if this makes people 
want to go to sleep though : )

You have 2 cows. Both are mad (not actually related to my idea but when I was 
thinking about how to explain it I thought of this 
http://thrandur.net/chitchat/two-cows-economics-world-iceland/ which is joyful)

You have 200(ish) cows of varying ages, with data on sex, date of birth, and 2 
traits. You want to find out whether there has been phenotypic progress in your trait(s) 
of interest over time. Your data has dates of birth in it, but you only need Year of
Birth. Extract this information from your data. Can you plot your trait in a way that 
separates the cows by year of birth? How do you quantify the level of progress (if any) 
in your trait over time?

Why? This is again probably a lot simpler than some of the others, but again like Suzanne 
I think a lot of beginners will want more practice with data manipulation. This is a pretty 
boring work related task but is the sort of thing that you might want to look at at the 
beginning of a genetic analysis? Its also something that could maybe be extended at a later date.
