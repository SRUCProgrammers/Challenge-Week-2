This is the file where we'll collect ideas for next weeks challenge! Please enter your name, a brief description of what you're 
proposing and why you think it's a good idea! 
Once we have enough (I hope you all can think of one! Please append the file with a an exclamation (!) mark beside your favourite idea, we'll count these
to decide the winner. 
The person with the best idea will host the meet!

Task: Estimate the number of rabbits in a population after 10 years
--a newly born pair of rabbits, one male, one female, build the initial population
--at the end of its second month a female can bring forth another pair of rabbits - and each month thereafter
--these rabbits are immortal (easy) OR rabbits die at 1 year of age (harder)
-- mating pair always produces one new pair (one male, one female) every month from the second month onwards
Why? this is a simple concept: can we translate it into code?

Task: Rise of the MACHINES -- Study a population of terminators over time.
**Scenario 1** (a bit easier)
-- Terminators are created by SKYNET at rate a
-- Terminators are killed by humans at rate b
AND/OR
**Scenario 2** (a bit harder)
-- Terminators are created by SKYNET at rate a
-- Terminators are killed by humans at rate b
-- Resources for the creation of Terminators is finite, i.e., Terminators have a carrying capacity K
Why? Scenarios 1 and 2 are examples of simple exponential and logistic growth respectively, and form a basis for modelling
in the fields of mathematical biology and epidemiology. I have chosen Terminators as a bit of fun but these ideas can be (and
are) applied to many population and disease systems. If people are interested in coding this problem I can give a brief
introduction to the models and their solution and we can look to write up some code in our chosen languages to solve such
problems. The type of modelling used above can be applied to many fields from traffic flow to wound healing, and is used to
study a multitude of problems in areas such as cancer growth and magnetohydrodynamics. Finally, the ideas involved in
*scenario 2* also have applications in statistics and could potentially be useful in your own area of study (you may have
already encountered it, e.g., logistic regression!).
