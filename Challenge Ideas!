Task: Estimate the number of rabbits in a population after 10 years
--a newly born pair of rabbits, one male, one female, build the initial population
--at the end of its second month a female can bring forth another pair of rabbits
--these rabbits are immortal (easy) OR rabbits die at 1 year of age (harder)
-- mating pair always produces one new pair (one male, one female) every month from the second month onwards
Why? this is a simple concept: can we translate it into code?
